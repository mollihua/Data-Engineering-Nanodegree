**Introduction**

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. Currently, the data resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. In this project, I create a Postgres database schema and ETL pipeline to assist the analytics team in understanding what songs users are listening to. 

**Table Creation**

Write statements in sql_queries.py to specify all columns for each of the five tables with the right data types and conditions. Then run "python3 create_tables.py" in terminal to create tables.
